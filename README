Minimal text editor written in C

It was tested in Linux terminal, with no gui.

Functionalities: insert text, backspace, delete (a line or a specific number of characters), go to character, go to line (for moving the cursor), undo, redo, quit & saving the text to a specific file.

Data structures:
- a simple linked list which holds a line of text
- a stack for storing the user commands
- a double linked list for storing the whole text, char by char
- if the 'undo' command is met, the previous command is stored in a queue and, if the 'redo' command is then met, the command is put back in the stack
